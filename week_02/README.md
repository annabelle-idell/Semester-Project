# Week 2 Notes

Potential Questions: 

1. How does declining birth rates and interest in having children relate to adoption rates?
2. Does the disproportionate representation of positive family dynamics in social media negatively affect personal satisfaction with family life?
3. How does military family lifestyle relate to deviant behavior in children?
4. How does financial stress influence marital satisfaction?

Feedback on my questions:

Those who gave feedback suggested that I specify if I'm focusing my studies in the United States, and whether I'm studying the data over time. Nobody gave feedback that the questions would be difficult to answer within two months. Regarding my first question, one suggestion was looking into demographics. People seemed to find this question the most interesting out of the four, and felt that there would be a lot of data on the subject. For my second question, it was recommended that I simplify the wording to make it less complicated. Some mentioned that it may be hard to find data on this specific subject as well. However, most thought that it was a relevant and applicable topic for today. For the third question, feedback that I received was to narrow down the question, specifically in regards to how I define deviant behavior. It was also suggested to look at any data collected by the VA on this topic. Finally, feedback for my fourth question noted thatit might do well to narrow down the question more because it is broad, and to specify whether time is part of the relationship that I'm studying or not. People thought this topic would have a lot of data to use.
