Welcome to DS 350 - Data Wrangling and Visualization.

My name is Annabelle Idell, and I'm a Marriage and Family Studies major with a minor in Statistics. My husband is a Mechanical Engineering student, and we will graduate in a year. I'm planning to attend online graduate school to become an LMFT afterwards. I'm excited to become more proficient in R and data wrangling!
